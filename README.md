![CAF Hackathon Header](/media/caf-hackathon-header.png)

## Overview

In this workshop, you will learn how to design an enterprise scale Landing Zone in Azure. You get familiar with the design principles and the critical design areas.

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to leverage the existing enterprise scale architectures, able to build your own as well as understanding how to establish a policy driven governance.

## Content in this Hackathon

While progressing in the cloud journey of Contoso Land Surveying the central IT department wants to learn more about the concept of a platform landing zone in Azure. Contoso understood that the Microsoft Cloud Adoption Framework offers best practices around an enterprise scale landing zone.

For the success of the platform landing zone Contoso want to understand the decisions to be made and get recommendation for their implementation.
